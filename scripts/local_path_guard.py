"""local-path-guard: fail if a tracked file carries an absolute filesystem path
out of somebody's machine.

The sibling agent-config-guard matches path NAMES. This class hides in file
CONTENT, which is how the 1.0.0 baseline shipped the author's sandbox root -
hardcoded in the benchmark harness and recorded in every run-record row - past
a green CI.

Absolute paths published on purpose (the neutral root kept in the run records)
are listed as prefixes in .publish-path-allowlist, one per line. Comparison is
done on forward slashes with runs of separators collapsed, so a single entry
covers the \\ and \\\\ spellings of the same path too.

Exit 0 clean, 1 with violations listed on stderr.

# Drive-absolute (X:\<dir>\<dir>, either slash, singled or doubled) and POSIX
# per-user home paths. Two guards against false positives: the lookbehind keeps
# "https://host/path" and prose like "moves:\nNext" from reading as drive
# letters, and the drive form needs two or more segments so a format string
# like "%d:\n" cannot match. Cost of that second rule: a bare drive plus one
# segment slips through. Everything that identifies a machine - a home dir, a
# nested project root - has depth.
#
# Examples in this file are written with <dir> placeholders on purpose: the
# guard scans every tracked file including itself, and a literal specimen path
# here would be a self-trip. It reads the working tree but only for files git
# tracks, so verify a change from a fresh clone - an untracked new file is
# invisible to it, which is exactly how this comment shipped broken once.
